<p>- This is the staff control panel, used by admins and help desk agents. They see tickets come in here and can do several other things in this system. .</p>

<p>- Within Admin Panel, go to  Agents, then Roles. From there, you'll press add new role.</p> 
<p>- Title the new role "Supreme Admin" and click the Permissions tab.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes our project. We have successfully completed the post-install configurations for osTicket. We will put our settings to the test in the next lab when we create and work tickets as a User, Agent, and Admin. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one! ðŸ˜Ž
